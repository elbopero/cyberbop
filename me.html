                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hello! I'm a dedicated cybersecurity enthusiast with a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology, specializing in cybersecurity. Technology has always been a passion of mine, and I’m constantly fascinated by the dynamic world of cybersecurity – a field where the challenges and solutions are always evolving.</p>

                <p>My journey in technology began with a deep curiosity about how things work under the surface, which eventually led me to pursue a formal education in IT. During my studies, I specialized in cybersecurity, focusing on areas like network security, threat detection, and cloud security. I developed a strong foundation in both theory and practical applications, which prepared me to tackle real-world security challenges.</p>

                <p>In addition to my studies, I had the rewarding experience of working as a student assistant, where I mentored and supported students in subjects like digital technology and cloud security. Helping others deepen their understanding of complex topics not only strengthened my own knowledge but also inspired me to continually seek new learning opportunities. I enjoyed breaking down technical concepts into digestible pieces, ensuring students felt confident in their abilities.</p>

                <p>Outside of work and academics, I'm deeply interested in exploring new technologies, staying updated on the latest cybersecurity trends, and expanding my skills through hands-on projects and platforms like TryHackMe. I’m driven by a desire to protect digital assets and enhance security practices, and I look forward to making a positive impact in this field.</p>
